### Data Sources
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the 'Oran Sales Data.csv' file. It contains detailed records of all sales made by the company, along with the revenue collected in diferent countries, regions and continent.

### Tools
- Mysql: Database hosting and management
- Powerbi: Analysis and Visualization

### Data Cleaning/ Preparation
  In the data cleaning and preparation phase, we performed the following task:
  - Data loading and inpection on Mysql
  - Joined multiple tables on Mysql
  - Created new columns from the existing ones on the table that are neccessary for the analysis on power querry
  - Deleted unwanted columns

### Exploratory Data Analysis
    The EDA performed on the dataset involves examining the data to reveal important insights, including:
    1. What are the monthly revenue trends?
    2. Which product categories are generating the most revenue?
    3. What are the profit margins across different regions and countries?
    4. How does the company's market share compare across different countries?
    5. Analysis on the customer.

###  Results and Findings
  The main insights from the ticket sales analysis are as follows:
  1. The monthly revenue shows noticeable ups and downs, suggesting that the company experiences seasonal changes in sales, likely influenced by product demand and marketing efforts.
  2. There’s a strong positive correlation (0.98) between total sales and the number of children, showing that families with kids tend to buy more.
  3. There’s a strong positive correlation of about 0.89 between sales quantity and product count, indicating that more products generally lead to higher sales, but not perfectly.
  4. Most sales, at 57.66%, come from the 44-64 age group, followed by 38.54% from the 65-85 group, indicating strong appeal to older customers, while the 86-115 age group accounts for just 3.8%, suggesting an opportunity to better engage this demographic.
  5. Canada tops the market with 1,534 units sold, followed by the U.S. at 1,250 and Australia at 967, while Germany trails behind with just 290 units, making Canada the clear leader.

### Limitation 
- The rate of product return by customers is more than 40% of the total number of orders and so, urgent attention is needed in that regard.
- There are plenty of incomplete records


### Recommendation
- All Product categories should have at least five sub-products
- Focus marketing efforts on customers with children and consider expanding product lines that appeal to families.
- Tailor marketing strategies to the 44-64 age group as the primary segment by developing loyalty programs targeting this age group

### Conclusion
Oran’s business performance withing the years under review is commendable but the dataset shows that there is enough room for improvement in sales and profit. Its major challenge is the rate at which products are returned indicating serious concern for the quality of products.
